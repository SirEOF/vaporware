The most amazing project ever that will fix security problems forever! All of security is fixed now! We can pack up and go home! Defends against all viruses, hackers, malware, and even stupid users!


Use:
=========

* First we must compile our security fixing tool using the GNU C Compiler for maximum compilation and compliance with SECURITY.

* gcc fix_security.c -o fix_security

* Now we must securely run our program, preferably as the 'root' user.

* ./fix_security

* Security fixed!
